# Project: Password Checker

This project serves as a practical application of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles, built during Section 4 of the *"Master unit testing with Node.js, TypeScript, Jest, and React"* course. Its core purpose is to hone skills in crafting high-quality TypeScript and Node.js software through rigorous unit testing with Jest.

## Test Driven Development Intro

It is exactly what it sounds - development driven by tests.

*For big projects, the objective would be to first achieve a very basic working state, and then write the tests.*

TDD is appropriate when we want to extend our already working application.
